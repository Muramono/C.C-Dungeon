ACTE Coding Competition platform/roguelike game
This is a game designed in GMS for a highschool programming competition called ACTE. This competition took place and was hosted at Univeristy of Alabama in Huntsville. The project contained various different types of enemies as well as various types of player attacks. The project was done with the help of two other teammates and myself. the team consisted of two major programmers and a side programmer/music devleloper. The end project contained multiple levels as well as a medium to simple boss battle at the very end. The project spanned a timeline of approx 1 month. It was mostly worked on during our members off time.
